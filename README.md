> Preview design comps in the browser

Compdrop is a simple way to view website designs in a desktop browser. Just drag and drop your images into the browser. Images are aligned to the top of the window and horizontally centered.

You are viewing files on your own machine. Compdrop does not store any of your data.

Based on the original [cmpdrp](https://github.com/lucasishuman/cmpdrp).

Compdrop is a progressive web app and you can use it even if youâ€™re have no internet connection.
